How would you represent a graph with million nodes ?

Answer: Before beginning the first question is how do we want the representation to be..is it 
one time use or used multiple times. Is it to be constructed at real time or stored and retrieved 
at run time. 

Assuming it needs to be persisted and flexible for updates, here is one approach. 
Identity clusters in the points based on some distance function (which might not be linear).
All the points in a cluster can be represented using an adjacency matrix approach and those edges
between the clusters can be represented using a hashmap. Clearly this approach depends on the type
of data objects and the type of clustering method adopted.
